    A class for detecting communities in dynamic networks using the Dynamo algorithm.
    
    This detector implements a dynamic community detection approach that:
    1. Handles evolving networks over time
    2. Maintains community structure while adapting to changes
    3. Uses the Louvain method as its base algorithm
    
    Key features:
    - Resolution parameter to control community size
    - Threshold for modularity gain
    - Support for power supply modularity
    - Seed for reproducibility
    
    Example usage:
    ```python
    detector = CommunityDetector(seed=42)
    communities = detector.dynamo(graph_t, graph_t1, comm_t)
